# Data-Cleaning-Python-Pandas

## Aim of Project
* Clean the dataset

## Context
In this data set there is deliberate issues that can be fixed in Pandas for practice purposes. The story is that I need to get this dataset into a usable state for a sales team, this means removing people who don't want to or can't be contacted and formating all information the same way. 

## Cleaning the data
* Dropping duplicates
* Dropping unneeded columns
* Striping/Removing unnecessary values
* Ensure formatting matches within each column
* Splitting a single into 3 columns
* Resetting index
